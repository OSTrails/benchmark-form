# Benchmark Form

[![SQAaaS badge](https://github.com/EOSC-synergy/SQAaaS/raw/master/badges/badges_150x116/badge_software_silver.png)](https://api.eu.badgr.io/public/assertions/CxgEgRBRSsCVraA8pVruEw "SQAaaS silver badge achieved")

This repository contains the source code for generating the contents of a Google Sheets Benchmark Algorithm file
used in conjunction with the [FAIR Champion Quality Assessment tool](https://tools.ostrails.eu/champion/assess/algorithm).

The form has four components:

1. General metadata section
2. Tests and their individual output weights
3. Conditions/Calculations, based on references to the tests
4. Guidance, which is intended to be shown in case a test fails

## Prerequisites

Knowledge of HTML, and/or access to a drag and drop HTML editing tool.

## Using the form

1. Download the generic_benchmark_algorithm_editor.html file
2. Open the file with a web browser
3. Edit the general metadata as required
4. Add one or more [OSTrails tests](https://tests.ostrails.eu/tests/)
5. Add conditions that the tests results must meet
6. Add Guidance that can help the User work out what to do if a test fails (optional)
7. Validate the form
8. Export the contents (in either CSV or Excel format)
9. If exported in CSV format, import the generated CSV file into a Google Sheets file,
otherwise upload the Excel file to Google Docs and open it with Google Sheets.
10. Generate a link with for the spreadsheet with permissions 'Anyone on the Internet can edit' (see File->Share->Share with others)
11. Open the [FAIR Champion Quality Assessment tool](https://tools.ostrails.eu/champion/assess/algorithms/new) and use the link
in the Benchmark Configuration Spreadsheet URI field (spreadsheet must have been registered via
[Register Benchmark Assessment Algorithm](https://tools.ostrails.eu/champion/algorithms/new))
12. Enter the URL of a digital object to evaluate in the GUID field
13. Press the Run Benchmark Quality Assessment button and wait for the results to be displayed

There is an example of a completed form (CDC Benchmark Algorithm Editor.html)
and a generated CSV file (generic_benchmark_algorithm_2025-08-19.csv) in the example directory.
